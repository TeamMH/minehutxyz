## DEVELOPERS

Minehut's Skripting community has continued to grow throughout the years, so we've adapted our website to help the developers as much as we can. We've teamed up with some of the best Skript developers out there to write the best tutorials and examples we can. \[Submit a post\]\]\(contribute.md\)

## ABOUT US

Minehut.xyz was founded on _**August 4th, 2020**_ by two members of the Minehut Community, **Tarna** _\(Senior Support @ Minehut\)_ & **Minehut** _\(Adam, Former Senior Support @ Minehut\)_.

We realised there was no dedicated place for Minehut tutorials where the community can easily upload their own tutorials, so we made one!
