# Format Chat
 
## OVERVIEW
 
Instead of having the default Minecraft chat format such as `<Trent>: Hey!`, you can create a custom format using Skript.
 
## CODE
 
```
on chat:
 set chat format to "%player%: %message%"
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You can use things such as `%player's prefix%` if you have Essentials & Vault installed.
