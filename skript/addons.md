# Addons

## **WHAT ARE ADDONS?**

Skript Addons are plugins that access the Skript plugin and register new syntaxes to the Skript language.

## **WHAT CAN ADDONS DO**

Addons are just like any other Java Minecraft plugins, meaning they use the [Java](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) coding language to create features. In this case, the plugin also uses the Skript API (plugin) to register new syntaxes using Java/Minecraft syntaxes.
