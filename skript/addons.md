# Addons

## **WHAT ARE ADDONS?**

Skript Addons are plugins that access the Skript plugin and register new syntaxes to the Skript language.

## **WHAT CAN ADDONS DO**

Addons are just like any other Java Minecraft plugins, meaning they use the [Java](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) coding language to create features. In this case, the plugin also uses the Skript API (plugin) to register new syntaxes using Java/Minecraft syntaxes. Addons are extremely useful, they open the door for many new possibilities inside of a server. 

## **WHERE CAN I FIND THEM?**

Skript addons can be found in various places. You can look on Skript documentation pages such as [SkriptHub](https://skripthub.net) or [skUnity](https://skunity.com). You can also find addons on [SpigotMC resource page](https://www.spigotmc.org) a good place to look is the Skript section [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/categories/skript.25/).

## **INTERESTING! HOW DO I MAKE ONE?**

*Note: Minehut does not support custom plugins, so developing a Skript Addon is not useful when using Minehut*
While I'm not going to make an entire section on making a Skript addon, you can check out a tutorial [here](https://forums.skunity.com/wiki/addon/).
