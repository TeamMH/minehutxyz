# Comments

## What are comments?

Comments are segments of your code that Skript will ignore, it's useful for taking notes directly in your code, without it interfering the outcome of your code.
You can write a comment in your code by putting "# (some text here!)"

## How to put special characters in strings

There may be a time where you want to put a hashtag, a double quote, or a percentage sign in a string, but when you try to do this, Skript will error.
You can work around this by putting two of the character in the string.

Examples:
```
"these are in ""quotes""."
"_Tarna_ just joined the server (##1543)"
"You are 90%% of the way there!"
```
