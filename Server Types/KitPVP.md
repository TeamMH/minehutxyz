# KitPVP server tutorial!

## Necessary Plugins

Plugins are very important for kitpvp, here are a few that are needed to make a good kitpvp on minehut!

Essentials - Has TONS of features like expanding on vanilla commands, and adding more. But the super important part is its kit capabilities.

Skript - Basically a requirement to make a unique server on a 12 plugin budget. Just a great tool overall to just do so much with.

Permission plugin - You want either "Permissions EX" or "Luckperms" to manage what privileges you want to give players.

Vault - Helps essential's built in economy system work and also your permission plugins. Definitely a must-have.

WorldEdit + WorldGuard - Unless you want breaking blocks and PvP in spawn, you want this. It lets you manage areas and either build quickly or set different rules that apply in that area.

## Optional Plugins

There are a few plugins that are good for additional features as well. Here are some good ones.

ProtocolSupport + OldCombatMechanics - Allows 1.8 players to join and it will also use 1.8 pvpo mechanics, much like Hypixel does.

Skript Addons - There are tons of other plugins that give skript more functionality and options to do, such as TuSKe or SkQuery

Tebex - If you want to sell ranks, you will want this plugin!

Holographic displays - Lets you put floating text around, can be good for directing newer players.

**The following plugins require a seperate plugin called ProtocolLib**

Matrix anticheat - A pretty great anticheat that can sniff put hackers pretty well. 

SuperVanish - The best plugin if you want to appear as if ypu are offline to players on your server.
