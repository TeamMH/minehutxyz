# Multiverse

## OVERVIEW

Multiverse provides the easiest to use world management solution for your Minecraft server

## CREATING A WORLD

The create command allows you to add new worlds to your server thus allowing many different worlds of many different types.Â 

To create a Multiverse world, use `/mv create (worldName) (worldType)`.
You can replace world name with your preferred world name, and replace world type with **normal**, **nether**, **flat_world** and others which you can view [here](https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Core/wiki/Command-Reference#create-command).
This requires the permission **multiverse.core.create**.

## TRAVELING TO A WORLD

The teleport command allows you to teleport yourself or others to a specified world.

To telepoet to a Multiverse world, use `/mv tp [player] (worldNams)`.
The player parameter is optional, and you can replace world name with the world you want to travel to.
This requires the permission **multiverse.teleport.self.NAME** OR **multiverse.teleport.other.NAME**.
