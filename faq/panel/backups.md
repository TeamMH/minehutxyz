# Backups

## OVERVIEW

Want to understand Minehut's backup system? Let go and explore it!

# HOW TO GET TO BACKUPS

To manage your backups, go to your [panel](https://minehut.com/panel/minecraft) (make sure you are signed in) and make sure that the server you want to manage backups on is online, after the server is online, find the "Backups" button, you will find this next to the "World" button.

## SERVER DATA

You will see two buttons under this, one of them will allow you to force save your server (Minehut auto saves every hour) and the another one will allow you to restore to the latest **save not backup**.

## SAVED BACKUPS

This may look confusing, but I'll try to explain it, every server on Minehut will have atleast one backup slot, this means if you have a backup in that slot and backed up your server, it will override that data with the new data. And also, you can get more backup slots by upgrading your server. 

To backup your server for the first time, click on the blue "BACKUP NOW" button, your server will then begin the backup process, when your server has finished this process, you will see a few new things such as the date the backup was made, a "Delete Backup" button, a "Replace Backup" button along with a "Restore Server" button to restore your server with the backup that you made and also a "description" textbox so you can remind yourself of why you made the backup.

That's basically you will need to know about Minehut's backup system, once you learned how everything works, you will become a backup professional!
