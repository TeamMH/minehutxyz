# Server Version

## 1.16

All Minehut servers run _\(PaperSpigot\)_ 1.16 servers. This will change with every new Minecraft update _\(however, it may take a few days before Minehut fully updates\)_. This does not mean older clients are unable to join your server _\(see below\)_.

## ALLOWING OLDER CLIENTS TO JOIN

There are currently two different methods of allowing older clients to join. Read below.

#### Method One

Install the plugin `ProtocolSupport`, and this will allow clients 1.8-1.16 to join.

#### Method Two

Install the plugins `ViaVersion`, `ViaBackwards` and `ViaRewind`. These three combined will allow 1.8-1.16 clients to join.

## 1.8 COMBAT

Most PvP servers will want the original combat system, this is how.

To allow 1.8 combat _\(no hit delay\)_, install the plugin `OldCombatMechanics`.
