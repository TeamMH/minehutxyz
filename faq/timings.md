# Timings

## OVERVIEW

This is where timings data becomes useful. They allow you to monitor how long it takes the plugins installed on your server to process an event. This allows you to see where lag issues arise, as a misbehaving plugin which takes a long amount to handle an event can lead to delays in the tick loop, and thus a server tick rate below 20.

## HOW TO USE TIMINGS

• To **enable timings**, run `/timings on`.
• Once you **experience a lag spike or tps drop**, use `/timings paste`.
• Use the page given in `/timings paste` to display the output in a graphical format. You can dig deeper into the issue by using the dropdown arrows on the bottom of the page.
