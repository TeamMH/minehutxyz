## OVERVIEW

Creating a void world is useful when creating lobbies for your server, and many other things. 

## HOW TO CREATE A VOID WORLD

First, you'll need to install the plugins **Multiverse** and **VoidGenerator**. If you don't know how to do this, you can read up on how to install plugins [here](plugins.md). 

After you've got those plugins installed, run the command`/mvcreate (new world name) normal -g VoidGenerator`. This will generate a new void world with the name you specified. You can get to this world using `/mvtp (world name)`.
