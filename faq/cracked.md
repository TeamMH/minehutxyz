# Cracked Clients

Cracked Minecraft is a version of Minecraft which you haven't paid for, Minehut does not support this.
If you play Minecraft using no password/offline accounts through launchers such as Tlauncher or HackPhoenix you're using an account that can't connect to Minehut. In order to play Minehut you must buy an account at [Minecraft's website](https://minecraft.net).
