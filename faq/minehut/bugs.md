# Bugs

## OVERVIEW

Minehut may have a few bugs, especially when new updates roll out. This means when a user reports a bug, it will help keep Minehut bug-free.

## REPORTING A BUG

Minehut uses GitHub *(like us)*, to keep track of bugs. You can report bugs [here](https://github.com/Minehut/Meta).
